# Grading rubric for discussion lead of a recent literature article (graduate students only)
On Thursday's, 1-3 individuals will lead a discussion of a recent literature
article based on the week's topic. The class will be divided into
four sections, typically Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion. You will be responsible
for introducing the paper and your reasoning for choosing it and then leading a jigsaw-style
discussion of the paper.

Your grade will be based on your
ability to introduce the topic, generate discussion amongst the class, and respond to
any questions the class may have.

## Discussion generation (50 points)
You will lead a jigsaw-style discussion of the paper. To help facilitate this, you will assign
groups based on sections of the paper in the Tuesday class preceding the Thursday discussion.
Each person in the class will read their section prior to Thursday's class. You will then
help to facilitate individual group discussions of each section. You will then help to facilitate
a reporting of the main findings of each section.
It is your job to ensure that the discussion is coherent
and addresses the main points of the study. Note: you will need to get
things moving if the discussion goes stale.

## Responses to class questions (50 points)
You may be asked to clarify portions of the paper. As such, please familiarize yourself
thoroughly with the paper and important literature cited within the article you choose.
