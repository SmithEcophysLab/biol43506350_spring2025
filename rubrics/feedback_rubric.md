# Grading rubric for reading feedbacks
For each class, students will be assigned a reading. 
Typically, on Tuesday's this will consist of a "classic" literature article and on Thursday's
this will be a more contemporary article. For the Tuesday article, students will read the entire
paper. For the Thursday article, students will only be assigned a portion of the paper to
facilitate a jigsaw-style discussion.

Students will be asked to read and provide a written
summary of the article (Tuesday) or article section (Thursday) during the corresponding class. 
The summary should consist of
a 1 paragraph summary that clearly shows that the student read the article or article section as well
as 2 questions that the student developed while reading the article or article section.

## Article or article section summary (50 points)
The summary should summarize the **5 most important points** the article or article section in the student's own words.
For each point, the student should state (1) what the main point is (1-2 sentences) and (2)
why this point was important (1-2 sentences).
This should not just paraphrase the Abstract.

## Questions (50 points)
The student should generate at least 2 questions based on the reading. These should be either
clarification or bigger picture questions. Students are strongly encouraged to ask
these questions during the discussion of the papers.
