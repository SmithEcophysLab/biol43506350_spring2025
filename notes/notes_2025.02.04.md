# Class notes for February 4, 2025

## Objectives
- Discuss physiological responses to light
- Discuss variations in light environments in ecological systems
- Examine the difference between instantaneous, acclimation, and adaptation responses to 
light availability, including differences in plant traits

## Agenda
1. (if needed) Finish lecture on plant physiology basics
	- [slides](../lecture_slides/slides_01.28.2025.pdf)
2. Lecture on light
	- [slides](../lecture_slides/slides_02.04.2025.pdf)
3. Discussion of Boardman (1977) (Lead: Nick)
4. Chat about class on Thursday

		- lead: Beatriz
	- divide into 3 groups of 5 for jigsaw
		- reading sections (per group)
			- note: everyone reads Summary, Introduction, and Conclusions
